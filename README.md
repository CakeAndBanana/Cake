# CakeBot
Welcome to the repo of CakeBot! Here you can find the source code for this bot.

CakeBot is a multipurpose bot that is made to create your life a bit easier.
The bot has support for osu! and twitter at the moment and is still being worked on.
While most of the values are preset and this bot isn't meant for running yourself, we have included an config you can change that will allow you to host this bot yourself if needed. This will be not a easy task to do because you will be required to have an SQL Server ready to be used for this bot.

This bot is using .Net Framework 4.6.1 with EF 6.2.1 for the model generation and database connection. This bot is one of the few that is using an remote database instead of a local one because we wanted to test this out and expand further and want to implement an API feature for this.

Some code can be sloppy and not-well written, feel free to make issues and PRs to help out on CakeBot ;)

## Features:

- osu! module with recently played, top and user profiles.

- twitter callback from feed (WIP).

- Profile/XP system with economy.

- Gamestats for BF4

- Administrative module
